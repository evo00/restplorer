# Restplorer

I created it to help anyone who wants to explore some APIs, whenever and wherever they are, without the hussle to install an app. Whether you're in a train, climb a mountain, or in a sunny beach, easy, we've got your back. Feel free to file some [issues/suggestions](https://github.com/rizqyhi/restplorer/issues).</p>

Anyway, thanks for using Resplorer. :)
